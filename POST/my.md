"Cloud computing" plays a vital role in the creation of software products and services. It's also one of the most highly sought-after skills in the tech industry.

In fact, most of the projects on this site will require cloud interaction of some sortâ€”particularly with AWS's serverless products.

## Getting Started

> To use AWS in these projects, we'll need to set up an account, the CLI, and the SDK.

### Create an account

If you don't already have an account then [sign up here](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup#/start).

Once you are signed up, you should be able to log in to the [AWS Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/). It might look overwhelming if you're seeing for the first time.

### Install the CLI

The AWS CLI is a command-line application that lets you interact with your AWS account from the terminal. It's available on all platforms.

If you are a proficient Python user, you can just install it with `pip`.

```bash
pip install awscli
```

Otherwise, check out the [official instructions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html).

Once installed, you should be able to run this command from the terminal to see its version.

```bash
aws --version
```
